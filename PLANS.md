## 2026-08-14: shareholder-meeting entity and relationship extraction

- Purpose: turn shareholder-meeting notices and results into evidence-backed people, organizations, agendas, and phase-aware relationships without treating candidates as current officers or inferring unnamed parties.
- Unresolved finding: the final production snapshot has not been rerun over all 71,965 historical pairs, so earlier full-history totals are superseded and must not be presented as current verification. Free-text extraction remains deliberately high-precision rather than exhaustive; ambiguous career statements, unknown proposal wording and unnamed or implicit transaction counterparties are not inferred. Person resolution remains issuer-scoped, and ShareholderMeeting identity remains disclosure-scoped, so separate NOTICE and RESULT receipts for the same physical meeting are not merged automatically.
